 * This pipe will modify the manifest generated by 'pixiManifest'. It will look for any images found in the atlas
 * files and remove them from the manifest. As the atlas files will be responsible for loading the textures.
 *
 * Once done, it rewrites the manifest.
 *
 * This should be added after the `pixiManifest` pipe.
 *
 * ensure that the same output path is passed to the pipe as the `pixiManifest` pipe. Otherwise
 * the manifest will not be found.
 *
 * As this pipe needs to know about all the textures in the texture files most of the work is done
 * in the finish method.
 *
 * Kind of like applying a patch at the end of the manifest process.
